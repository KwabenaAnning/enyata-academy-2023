A var can be accessed only within that function.
the let solves the problem of the var and also more flexible to use than the var.
Variables declared with the const maintain constant values therfore one has to declare a variable and or assign a variable  to define it
To declarea string, the characters has to be put in a double quote
Yes, we can. for a single character like 'a' you can use the single quote and for a a sentence or a a word you should use the double quote
"9" is a string  and 9 is a number since it has no double quote
declaration means using the variable for the first time. Redeclaration is when a variable is modified. 
assign is like cloning an object and using 'let' or 'var', you can reassign an object by redefining the content.
